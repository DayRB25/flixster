### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, based on the lessons in class I felt prepared to complete the first 5 core requirements. The last requirement (responsiveness) was not addressed directly in class, but I had prior experience, so it was really no trouble.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

Overall, if I had more time, I would have taken a slightly more methodical approach to the entire project-- outlining all of the requirements, what these requirements would need for completion, any possible dependencies, and also outlined some key points at which commits would be made. Besides that, on a more micro-level, if I had more time, I would try to organize my script.js file a bit better. There are some instances of repeated code that could be isolated and made into their own methods for better organization and maintenance. Furthermore, I would have spent a bit more time with the design of the pop-up. Finally, if I had more time, I also would have extended the capability of the search feature to also search by things like genre.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Everything went well with the demo. All features worked as expected!
